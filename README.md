# KNX TP-UART bus coupler module

## Description

Small KNX bus coupling module to connect microcontrollers like Arduino over the serial interface. Uses the first version of the Siemens TP-UART chip and is easy to handle by hand. Perfectly suited for small KNX self-made devices.

*This is just a DIY board, so there is no official KNX stack to configure via the ETS software.*
